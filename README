== Bustle - To-do list with extra padding

Status: Currently under development (in other words not working yet!)

Bustle extends the to-do list concept with a few extra features to make it useful to manage small projects with a handful of people. It tries to keep it simple with a clear interface. It comes from my need to manage a small team of developers and allow our customers to easily view and add tasks.

Default database is SQLite3. db/development.sqlite contains the todo's for bustle

rake db:setup
