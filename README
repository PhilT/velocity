== Bustle - To-do list with extra padding

Bustle extends the to-do list concept with a few extra features to make it useful to manage small projects with a handful of people. It tries to keep it simple with a clear interface. It comes from my need to manage a small team of developers and allow our customers to easily view and add tasks.

Default database is SQLite3. Use db:seed to populate the database with static data needed by Bustle
