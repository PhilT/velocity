Velocity - Simple Release Management
====================================

Status: *Beta*

As we work we find features we use and those we don't. Some filtering has been removed and we are now working on story support.

Velocity extends the to-do list concept with a few extra features to make it useful to manage small projects with a handful of people. It tries to keep it simple with a clear interface. It comes from my need to manage a small team of developers and allow our customers and developers to easily view and add tasks.

Default database is now MySQL. Users can be added by other users. If no users are in the database Velocity allows the first one to be added without logging in.

Features:
* Inline editing of task details
* Drag to re-order tasks
* Current and future releases
* Simple state transitions (move to current release, start, complete, verify)
* Simple categories: feature, bug, refactor
* Filters: show only users tasks, hide completed tasks
* Details view: Shows started/completed and verifier
* Mark a release as complete - emails all users a feature and bug list. Fails if tasks have not been verified. Does not include any tasks that are incomplete
* View tasks in previous release
* Embed links in task descriptions
* Show velocity for previous releases (Velocity is very simply the number of features completed)
* Live updates - Users are notified when new tasks are created, a task is assigned to them or tasks are reordered or a release is finished. If details or state of a task has changed then the task is simply updated inline without notification.
* Mark a task invalid. Gets included when a release is completed

Currently working on:
* Stories

Planned:
* Hoptoad Integration
* Stats page
* Multi-project support
